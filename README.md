# Phoenix Online

To start the basis of this topic, let's look at a logo and we'll talk about what we like / dislike, 
this (hopefully) makes it a lot easier for you.


![Phoenix logo](https://images-platform.99static.com/dgTauPKnoJHER65ifl20SCAlcp4=/fit-in/900x675/99designs-contests-attachments/47/47995/attachment_47995544) 


#### Some other examples we (kinda) like
- [This](https://as2.ftcdn.net/jpg/02/24/45/67/500_F_224456759_YTDgrBCsjGOMebsS39IVg69YezZTtLdH.jpg), though it looks too much like a swan
- We really like the head of [this](https://www.codester.com/static/uploads/items/14306/preview/003.jpg) one

### Likes
- The circular aspect of this image, the fact that it isn't an exact circle, but it hints at that geometric shape, 
this makes some combinations possible (e.g. putting the logo in the O of Phoenix `O` `nline`) and so on...
- Relatively symmetrical, making a logo fully symmetrical can easily lower the quality of a logo, we don't want to force symmetry but rather 
celebrate it where possible, the wings for example are much nicer when symmetrical for us while the head shouldn't be
- The above point becomes even more interesting when you look at this image, if you would divide the image in four equal quadrants, 
they would all be almost equally filled
- The simplicity, we like logo's where clever use of shapes allows the logo to show a detailed shape without the actual details being present
- Gradient, we really like the idea of our logo to not be to flat, more specifically we want a gradient to be present in the fill of the logo
- Purple, gold, these are some of the colors we really would like to incorporate into the design of our logo, website, ... 
Honestly, when looking at the white, purple, gold calus theme from destiny we both fell in love with those color combinations, so that would be awesome (if possible)
- On the other hand a more, present color combination is orange/red/pink, so if you can make something with a similar color combination like [this](https://www.brandsupply.nl/upload/project_files/aedd0b49ab08d7b51cb05108a68d29ac.jpg) that would also be very nice
- Another important fact about this gradient, is that it's consistent over the entire logo. We don't want to combine multiple gradients into one logo.
- Finally speaking about colors, we don't want them to define our logo, our logo in black or white should be just as defining towards what it is (shape) as the actual colors would. [This](https://img.favpng.com/9/0/12/logo-phoenix-illustration-png-favpng-bPSWE9dLfqAMWJwvZeAErTs4U.jpg) for example wouldnt work in all black.
- The wings are a really important part of this logo for us, they shouldnt be to overbearing and over focused like [here](https://cdn3.vectorstock.com/i/1000x1000/15/77/phoenix-logo-vector-1921577.jpg)
but they can and should draw the attention of most viewers
- We like it when spacing is used to differentiate shapes inside of a logo, for example, the way the body is accentuated with the white spacing in it looks really nice to us. Though obviously this shouldn't be done too excessively.
- Elegance, this is quite difficult to explain, but our logo needs to be elegant, it shouldn't be aggressive / assertive.

### Dislikes
- We don't like text in the logo itself, we want to combine the logo with our company name on media like our business cards and such, but the logo should be a standalone
shape that does not at all rely on the company's name
- The head, the head in this logo looks more like a chicken to us and takes away some of the finesse of the phoenix as an animal
- Outline, we dont like it when a logo has an outline, see an example [here](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a2/98/f7/a298f7cbd809d70eaab336ec1936c34f.jpg), where the black outline around the logo is something we really dislike
- Sharpness, the logo above here uses sharp and curved edges in combination, which we like, having a logo like [this](https://isrgp.nl/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/phoenix-logo-v2.0.png) would be way too sharp for us
- When it doesn't look like a phoenix, we obviously don't want a chicken, fox, swan, ... we want a phoenix :wink: 
- Just the head, a lot of logo's use only the head of an animal, we really like the entire shape of a phoenix, so it's important to us that our logo consists of the entire body
- Firefox, we want to watch out that we don't go too close to the [firefox logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Firefox_Logo%2C_2017.png) so try to steer clear of that if possible
- Too much disconnect, this [logo](https://res.cloudinary.com/teepublic/image/private/s--IG2NSPXS--/t_Resized%20Artwork/c_fit,g_north_west,h_1054,w_1054/co_ffffff,e_outline:53/co_ffffff,e_outline:inner_fill:53/co_bbbbbb,e_outline:3:1000/c_mpad,g_center,h_1260,w_1260/b_rgb:eeeeee/c_limit,f_jpg,h_630,q_90,w_630/v1533187042/production/designs/2968283_0.jpg) has a lot of whitespace and disconnect to it, we want more of a whole shape
- Blue, simple enough, we don't want any blue in there :wink:
